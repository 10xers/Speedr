# Speedr - The Speedy Email Reading App.

Speedr is an email speed-reading client.

Normal, un-enhanced reading only allows you to process around 250-300 words per minute. With Speedr, you can increase that to 700 or
higher, allowing you to process even a weeks worth of emails in a few minutes, without skim reading or skipping any
possibly important content.

Speedr uses advanced word analytics to decide exactly how long to display each word, which allows you to go upwards of 700
words per minute without skipping a beat.

Speedr is currently in Pre-Alpha, and major improvements are being made all the time.
